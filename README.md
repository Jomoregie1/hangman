## Introduction
Hangman is a classic word guessing game. This project is a Python implementation where the computer selects a word at random from a predefined list, and the user attempts to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses.

The aim of this project was to create an interactive command-line application that reinforces fundamental Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, and data structures like lists and sets. During the development process, I enhanced my understanding of Python's standard libraries, improved my problem-solving skills, and learned how to structure code more efficiently.

## Installation
To run this game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Once Python is installed, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/hangman.git
cd hangman
```

## Usage
To start the game, navigate to the cloned directory and run:

```bash
python hangman.py
```
Follow the on-screen prompts to guess letters. You will be informed if your guess is correct or incorrect, and you can see how many lives you have left after each guess.

## File Structure
The project consists of the following files:

- hangman.py: The main Python script that runs the Hangman game.
- words.txt: A text file containing potential words to guess. (This file is hypothetical; you'd need to create it if you want a separate word list file.)
- README.md: This file, which provides information about the project and how to run it.

## License
